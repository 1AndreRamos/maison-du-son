Laura Steil is postotdoctoral researcher at the C2DH. She holds a PhD in cultural anthropology from the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, Paris, France (2015). At the Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH), she is part of the PopKult60 team, and examines bals (dance parties) in the Minett, with a microhistorical focus on the neighbourhood of the "Grenz" in Esch-sur-Alzette. Her work focuses on popular dance practices and environments, which she approaches from an embodied ethnographic and historiographic perspective. She is the author of "Boucan. Devenir quelqu'un dans le milieu afro" (2021).

She is particularly interested in the construction of cultural memory, and looks at contexts in which generational, social, or spatial ruptures have complicated traditional modes of nurturing community remembrance. She investigates how experiential “sites”, such as bals, nightclubs, videoclips or social media stories, may act as technologies of memory, suturing individuals into larger collective histories and producing deeply felt recollections about pasts they did not necessarily experience. Her research project at the C2DH includes reenacting a 1960s "dancing", a space and time where people dance to live orchestra music.
