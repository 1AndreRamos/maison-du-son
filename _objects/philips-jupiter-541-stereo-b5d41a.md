title: The Philips Jupiter 541 Stereo B5D41A
abstract: The Philips radio "Jupiter 541 Stereo" with the type designation "B5D41A" is a tabletop unit with a normal width but a height of just under 25 cm. Philips built this radio from 1964 to 1967. The stereo radio is operated by 10 pushbuttons, 2 large rotary controls and 2 small vertical rotary controls for height and depth. At the rear, the radio has a tape/record player and an aerial connection. There are also connections for external Stereo speakers. The two built-in loudspeakers with a diameter of 20 cm provide a sufficiently good sound.
